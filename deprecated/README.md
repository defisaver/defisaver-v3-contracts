# Deprecated

This folder contains all deprecated DFS contracts, tests, strategies, that are no longer used in production.
These contracts are retained for reference purposes only and will not be maintained, included in the build process, or covered by the bounty program.
Tests are left as examples of contract interactions but should not be run in the current setup and are not expected to work.
